45 min: Design pattern called ViewModels
ViewModel: Give your view a reference to this, and it only holds the info that the view needs to render itself. ViewModels can also implement the actions for the view, but he doesn't think thats a good idea.

Works best with a binding mechanism eg. ReactiveCocoa when you have mutable models.
